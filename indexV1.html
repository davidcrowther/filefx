    <p><strong>The number one thing that most photographers struggle with is building and maintaining a list of clients with the right projects, who have good budgets, and want access to the exact style of photography they produce.</strong></p> 
    <p>As a photographer, you will most likely have a speciality that you love to do - which is why File Fx is the best option for a photographer who wants the right clients, without having to take on jobs they don’t want to do.</p>
    <p>We realise that you only want to do work that you are good at, and enjoy, which is why we created our databases full of the right photography buyers, and also the ability to search for specific criteria, and then target them with personalised email campaigns.</p>

    <h3>Have You Used A Service Like This Before?</h3>

    <p>If so, you probably will have noticed a few things. Other companies will tell you how big their lists are, when in fact a number of contacts on there just lead to a redundant email address. The difference between us and other list owners, is that we constantly check our list for discrepancies, and, we carefully monitor who goes on the list in the first place.</p>
    <p>We constantly get quality feedback from our subscribers excitedly telling us about new clients they have landed, which has helped their business to take a huge leap forward.</p>
    <p>Another mistake that others make is charging an expensive price, when the quality is just not there. At File Fx, we have been extremely careful about making quality our #1 priority, and also giving you access to contacts who love your style, while making the service affordable to more photographers. We are priced lower than our competition, because we know that we offer a better quality of contacts, and we want to prove it.</p>
    <p>All of the people on our list are active photograph buyers, people such as:</p>
